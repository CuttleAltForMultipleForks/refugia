As expected, the <span style="color:rgb(64, 89, 156);">**PNU**</span> courts have, in [? if ppp_judiciary < 2 : two unanimous decisions?][? if ppp_judiciary >= 2 : twp 4-1 decisions ?] found not only the decree establishing the People's Courts as unconstitutional but the very **state of emergency** through which we currently rule by decree. Of course, these actions are taken in a futile attempt to preserve their institutional power and destabilize the revolution so they may uproot it, but all the same this has swung the police back into the <span style="color:rgb(64, 89, 156);">**PNU**</span>'s hands and weakened our hold over the administration as bureaucrats resign and refuse to enforce our "unconstitutional" decrees - it seems the Supreme Court retains some legitimacy, even if only in the eyes of a powerful minority.

The two opinions of the Supreme Court are immediately overturned by the Vosallo People's Court, though this is mainly a symbolic gesture to display the weakness of the Supreme Court and unfortunately carries much less weight in terms of actual institutional change.

Meanwhile, another parallel society has begun to coalesce around the <span style="color:rgb(64, 89, 156);">**PNU**</span> following the establishment of various party-affiliated organizations, including the **Refugian Guard**, a seeming reactionary counterweight to our increasingly powerful Liberty Guard. The reactionaries may be preparing for this crisis to escalate into something further.

- @piano_forte: *And escalate, it shall.*
- @caution: Interesting.

@scardinaist_protests

The Scardinaists on our party right are opposed to the idea of effectively wielding riots and our own paramilitary to destroy the police and Supreme Court. To prevent a rebellion within the party, concessions may be necessary.

- @dont_care: The Scardinaists mean nothing. The Revolution is *everything*.
- @erm: We will leave the Supreme Court alone, but still march against the police.
- @fine: Drop the idea.

go-to: forte_2

This course of action strains the party's unity, but allows us to continue undisturbed. [? if scardinaist_dissent >= 30 : However, the right-wing of our party has begun to openly rebel in response. ?]

@erm 
on-arrival: scardinaist_dissent -= 5; caterinoist_dissent += 2
go-to: forte_2

It's something, but the Scardinaists would still prefer we refrained from this course of action altogether. Still, with some convincing words from the President, they cave to the idea.

@fine 
on-arrival: caterinoist_dissent += 10; scardinaist_dissent -= 20; scardinaist_strength += 5

The Caterinoists are increduled that the plan we just adopted is now being dropped, over Scardinaist protests no less. Regardless, we will spend more time preparing.

@caution 
on-arrival: caterinoist_dissent += 5; strife -= 1; 

Interesting. It is too soon to act - we will have to observe. The Caterinoists criticize this course of action, but remain committed to fighting off reaction, even if at a slower pace than preferred.

@forte_2

With Scardinaist dissent out of the way, there is the matter of investment into this course of action. We have already built up protests substantially - should we attempt to further bolster our forces?

- @invest: Mobilize every party organization behind this plan!
- @invest_lesser: Make substantial preparations for the plan.
- @good: The current protests are enough.

We mobilize every single one of the <span style="color:rgb(238, 117, 36);">**PPP**</span>'s affiliated organizations behind this plan. The reactionaries must be beaten at all costs.

on-arrival: scardinaist_dissent += 3; resources -= 1; strife += 1; revolutionary_fatigue += 1; lg_militancy += 0.01; lg_strength += 5; pnu_turnout -= 0.01

This is a very crucial plan, thus it is important we make substantial preparations for it. When the time comes, the <span style="color:rgb(238, 117, 36);">**PPP**</span> will emerge victorious.

@good
on-arrival: caterinoist_dissent += 5

The current extent of the protests is enough to all but guarantee the success of our plan.
